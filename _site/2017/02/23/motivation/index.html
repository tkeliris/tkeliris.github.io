The effects of weak security mechanisms on embedded devices could be devastating for our personal privacy, but the dangers don’t stop there. For embedded devices that are deployed in critical infrastructure, such as systems that provide us with power, water, food, etc., the stakes are much higher. To that end, my research, and extrapolating my current trajectory, my future career, aims to investigate the security of these devices in an effort to understand weak points, raise awareness about them and propose ways to mitigate these vulnerabilities. With my current point of view, I believe this path is an effective way for me to maximize my usefulness and leverage my skills towards serving and contributing to society.
