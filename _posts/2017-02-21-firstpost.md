I started making this website (... stops writing and goes and checks GitHub commits ...) roughly two years ago. Wow, that's a long time ago. To my defence I was maintaining another personal website with Google Sites. Google Sites is pretty awesome, but for a guy like me it is always attractive to be able to modify and add content to your website by just pushing a git commit, so jekyll and free hosting from GitHub it is!

My aim is to use this blog as a public repo of cool stuff I find and do, as well as notes-to-self. That way I have a place to archive and quickly dig up that one stackoverflow answer I googled a googol times and followed the same path to discover over and over (and over) again. Also I hope other people will find some of this stuff interesting and useful. Fun fact, did you know googol is \\( 10^{100} \\)? Also how cool is it to have \\( \LaTeX \\) in your site?

If you like what you see site-wise feel free to head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tkeliris/tkeliris.github.io) and have a look under the hood. If you like what you see content-wise and want to chat (or buy me beer, or hire me) drop me a line, I'm always happy and passionate to talk about the stuff I do!
