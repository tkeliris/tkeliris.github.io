Being in an academic environment, I feel it is important to find fun and engaging ways to excite people about research and new things. To that end, one of the things I did this year was to establish a weekly event for the different security teams here at NYU Abu Dhabi (yes there is more than 1 security team). The event, judiciously named NYUAD CyberMondays is hosted every Monday (duh) and lasts for an hour, where we sit together and watch YouTube presentations from top security conferences (e.g., DEFCON, BlackHat) over popcorn. The most interesting part so far are the discussions right after the talks, where different people have different questions and different points of view.

So far the event is great (mark 2017 as the year the word great lost its meaning) and it's gaining traction. I really hope this will carry on and will come to be a tradition of the security labs at NYUAD!
