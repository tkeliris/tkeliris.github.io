I have been on the lookout for an efficient and accurate way to perform grep searches for a sequence of bytes on a binary file. Something along the lines of this stackoverflow post: [Using grep to search for hex strings in a file](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6319878/using-grep-to-search-for-hex-strings-in-a-file). Note that this doesn't work when you have \x00 bytes in your search sequence.

Today I ran into a great program by [tmbinc](http://debugmo.de/) called [bgreb](https://github.com/tmbinc/bgrep). Excellent tool, thanks for developing and sharing it!
